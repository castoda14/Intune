The log file will output to ***/Library/Logs/Microsoft/IntuneScripts/ControlledAuditRecords/ControlledAuditRecords.log*** by default. Exit status is either 0 or 1. To gather this log with Intune remotely take a look at  [Troubleshoot macOS shell script policies using log collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts#troubleshoot-macos-shell-script-policies-using-log-collection)
