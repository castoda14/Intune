**It is strongly recommended to deployed [this script](https://github.com/microsoft/shell-intune-samples/tree/master/macOS/Config/Disable%20File%20Sharing), that will disable file sharing before disabling Bonjour Advertising Service.**

**It also strongly recommended to deploy these policies below to managed Mac-devices via Intune before disabling Bonjour Advertising Services.**

The log file will output to ***/Library/Logs/Microsoft/IntuneScripts/DisableBonjourAdvertisingServices/DisableBonjourAdvertisingServices.log*** by default. Exit status is either 0 or 1. To gather this log with Intune remotely take a look at  [Troubleshoot macOS shell script policies using log collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts#troubleshoot-macos-shell-script-policies-using-log-collection)
