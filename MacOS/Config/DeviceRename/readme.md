# Scripts to rename Mac devices

In this folder, we have gathered two different options to rename Intune-managed Mac-devices as an example.

## Option Number 1: Script to rename a Mac device based on model type and serial number (DeviceRename.sh)

This script renames a Mac device by looking at the model type and at the serial number
This is ideal for devices that are enrolled without user affinity. The script can be further customized to include the user name as part of the device rename.

The script consists of five steps:
1) Determine the model type and, based on the retrieved type, set a 4 characters variable $ModelCode
    e.g. MacBook Air ==> $ModelCode = MABA
2) Collect the serial number and keep the first 10 characters
    e.g. Serial Number = C02BA222DC79 ==> $SerialNum = C02BA222DC
3) Check MDM enrollment type and set $OwnerPrefix variable
    e.g. enrolled via Apple Business Manager ==> $OwnerPrefix = CO, otherwise ==> $OwnerPrefix = BYO
4) Fetch country code, based on current IP address, set variable $Country
    e.g. 209.142.68.29 ==> $Country = US
5) Build the final name by combining $ModelCode and $serial
    e.g. ABM device ==> $NewName = CO-MBA-C02BA222DC-US, BYOD ==> BYO-MBA-C02BA222DC-US

```bash
# Define variables
appname="DeviceRename"
logandmetadir="/Library/Logs/Microsoft/IntuneScripts/$appname"
log="$logandmetadir/$appname.log"
CorporatePrefix="CO"   # May be adjusted, e.g. your company shortname, or set to empty string
PersonalPrefix="BYO"   # May be adjusted, or set to empty string
ABMOnly="false"        # Change to "true" to change device names for ABM enrolled devices only
EnforceBYOD="false"    # Change to "true" if you want to run the script repeatedly and enforce device names for BYOD devices
```

### Script Settings

- Run script as signed-in user : No
- Hide script notifications on devices : Not configured
- Script frequency : Not configured
- Mac number of times to retry if script fails : 3

### Log file example

>**Note:** The log file will output to **/Library/Logs/Microsoft/IntuneScripts/DeviceRename/DeviceRename.log** by default. Exit status is either 0 or 1. To gather this log with Intune remotely take a look at  [Troubleshoot macOS shell script policies using log collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts#troubleshoot-macos-shell-script-policies-using-log-collection)

```
## Option Number 2: Script to rename a Mac device based on fixed country code and serial number (DeviceRename2.sh)

This script renames a Mac device enrolled from Apple Business Manager by looking at the defined [ISO 3166 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes) you have configured to the script and at the serial number of the device.

This script is ideal for situations when you want to rename Corporate-devices that are on Apple Business Manager and not rename BYOD-devices.

The script consists of five steps:
1) Admin first determines the ISO 3166 country code to the line 25 to the script (see more on "Defined Variables" below)
    e.g. ISO 3166 country code of Finland is "FI" so...
    FI ==> $CountryCode
2) Check if managed device is enrolled to Apple Business Manager. If yes, we can proceed. Otherwise, we script will be closed and device will not be renamed.
3) Collect the serial number of the device
    e.g. Serial Number = C02BA222DC79 ==> $SerialNum
4) build the final name by combining $CountryCode and $SerialNum
    e.g. ABM device ==> $NewName = FI-C02BA222DC79

```bash
# Define variables
appname="DeviceRename"
logandmetadir="/Library/Logs/Microsoft/IntuneScripts/$appname"
log="$logandmetadir/$appname.log"
CountryCode="FI"         # ISO 3166 Country Code
```
