# Disable creation of ".DS_Store" -files on network shares and removable drives
This Custom Script disables creation of ".DS_Store" -files on network shares and removable drives. Running this frequently via Intune to managed Mac-devices will make sure that ".DS_Store" -files are not polluting network shares and removable drives that are irritating for non-Mac users.

## Script Settings

- Run script as signed-in user : Yes
- Hide script notifications on devices : Yes
- Script frequency : Every 1 day
- Number of times to retry if script fails : 3

## Log File

The log file will output to ***~/Library/Logs/Microsoft/IntuneScripts/DisableCreationOfDS_StoreFilesOnNetworkSharesAndRemovableDrives/DisableCreationOfDS_StoreFilesOnNetworkSharesAndRemovableDrives.log*** by default. Exit status is either 0 or 1. To gather this log with Intune remotely take a look at  [Troubleshoot macOS shell script policies using log collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts#troubleshoot-macos-shell-script-policies-using-log-collection)

**Note:** Please notice that on actual log, variable *$USER* is replaced with actual username of the user where script will be run.
