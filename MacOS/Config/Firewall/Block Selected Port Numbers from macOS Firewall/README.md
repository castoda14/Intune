# Block Selected Port Numbers from macOS Firewall
This custom script blocks following port numbers from macOS Firewall:

 Port Number| Port | More information |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| 135 (TCP) | Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Endpoint Mapper service | Blocks Port Number 135 TCP used by Microsoft RPC, which can be exploited for remote code execution. |
| 135 (UDP) | Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Endpoint Mapper service | Blocks Port Number 135 UDP used by Microsoft RPC, which can be exploited for remote code execution. |
| 137-139 (TCP) | NetBIOS and Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS)| Blocks Port Numbers 137-139 TCP used by NetBIOS and WINS, which can be a vector for various attacks. |
| 137-139 (UDP) | NetBIOS and Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) | Blocks Port Numbers 137-139 UDP used by NetBIOS and WINS, which can be a vector for various attacks. |
| 445 (TCP) | Microsoft SMB Domain Server / Microsoft-DS (Active Directory, Windows shares)| Blocks Port Number 445 TCP used by Microsoft SMB Domain Server / Microsoft-DS (Active Directory, Windows shares), which is often targeted by malware. |
| 1433-1434 (TCP) | Microsoft SQL Server | Blocks Port Numbers 1433-1434 TCP used by Microsoft SQL Server, which can be exploited if not properly secured. |
| 1433-1434 (UDP) | Microsoft SQL Server | Blocks Port Numbers 1433-1434 UDP used by Microsoft SQL Server, which can be exploited if not properly secured. |
| 3389 (TCP) | Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) | Blocks Port Number 3389 TCP used by Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), which is common target for brute force attacks. |
| 1900 (UDP) | SSDP, Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), Bonjour| Blocks Port Number 1900 UDP used by SSDP, Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) and Bonjour, which can be exploited for network discovery and attacks. |
| 20-21 (TCP) | FTP | Blocks Port Numbers 20-21 TCP used by FTP, which can be insecure if not properly configured. |
| 20-21 (UDP) | FTP | Blocks Port Numbers 20-21 UDP used by FTP, which can be insecure if not properly configured. |
| 23 (TCP) | Telnet | Blocks Port Numbers 23 TCP used by Telnet, which transmits data in plaintext and is insecure. |

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Please note that there is a possibility that your Managed Mac-device may not use some of these port numbers or services above. Some of the services may also heavily related only to Windows-environment e.g. Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Endpoint Mapper service or Microsoft SQL Server. This script have been created in order to block these port numbers that are, in general, and usually used for malicious purposes.

> [!NOTE]  
> More information of port numbers used by Apple software products can be found [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/103229) and [here](https://chadstechnoworks.com/wptech/os/mac_os_x_default_port_list.html)

## Prerequisities
**It is strongly recommended to deployed following script and policies to make sure that these services, that are using one of these port numbers, are not enabled and trying to calling to these blocked port numbers for nothing.**

| Port Numbers| Port | Link | More information
| -------- | ------- | -------- | -------- |
| 137-139 (TCP & UDP) | NetBIOS and Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) | [Disable SMB 1, NetBIOS and netbiosd](https://github.com/microsoft/shell-intune-samples/tree/master/macOS/Config/Disable%20SMB%201%2C%20NetBIOS%20and%20netbiosd) | Disables NetBIOS and WINS. |
| 1900 (UDP) | Bonjour | [Disable Bonjour Advertising Services](https://github.com/microsoft/shell-intune-samples/tree/master/macOS/Config/Disable%20Bonjour%20Advertising%20Services) | Disables Bonjour Advertising Services. |


## Script workflow diagram

Here is the workflow of the script (click to enlarge the image):
 
![Getting Started](Diagram.png)

 
## Script Settings

- Run script as signed-in user : No
- Hide script notifications on devices : Yes
- Script frequency : Every 1 day
- Number of times to retry if script fails : 3

## Log File

The log file will output to ***/Library/Logs/Microsoft/IntuneScripts/FirewallBlockPortNumbers/FirewallBlockPortNumbers.log*** by default. Exit status is either 0 or 1. To gather this log with Intune remotely take a look at  [Troubleshoot macOS shell script policies using log collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts#troubleshoot-macos-shell-script-policies-using-log-collection)
