# Microsoft Teams

Here are some example scripts showing how to use [Intune Shell Scripting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts) to install or uninstall an application. In this folder, we provide some scripts for Citrix Workspace.

## Install Microsoft Teams (installTeamsClassic.zsh, installTeamsV2.zsh)

These scripts installs Microsoft Teams. There are two versions of the Teams Clients and you'll find a sample script for each.

- Microsoft Teams classic
- Microsoft Teams

More information about [The new Microsoft Teams desktop client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/new-teams-desktop-admin).

### Audio Driver for Microsoft Teams classic

To share system audio in a teams classic call, you also need to install the Teams Audio Driver. This is included with the standard package but on older packages didn't used to be installed since it interrupted any audio that was playing. Both of the sample packages shared here will force the Audio Driver to automatically install to prevent standard desktop users not being able to install it later.

### Quick Run

Classic
```
sudo /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/shell-intune-samples/master/macOS/Apps/Teams/installTeamsClassic.zsh)"
```

Teams V2
```
sudo /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/shell-intune-samples/master/macOS/Apps/Teams/installTeamsV2.zsh)"
```


### Script Settings (installTeamsClassic.zsh, installTeamsV2.zsh)

- Run script as signed-in user : No
- Hide script notifications on devices : Not configured
- Script frequency : Not configured
- Number of times to retry if script fails : 3

### Log File (installTeamsClassic.zsh, installTeamsV2.zsh)

The log file will output to ***/Library/Logs/Microsoft/IntuneScripts/Microsoft Teams*** by default. Exit status is either 0 or 1. To gather this log with Intune remotely take a look at  [Troubleshoot macOS shell script policies using log collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts#troubleshoot-macos-shell-script-policies-using-log-collection)
